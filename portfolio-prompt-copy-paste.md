Create an advanced personal portfolio website with the following specifications.

**Theme**
- Dark theme: black background, purple highlights, white text. Modern, clean, visually appealing.
- Color tokens: background `#0a0a0a` or `#0f0f0f`; primary text `#ffffff` or `#f5f5f5`; secondary text `#a1a1aa`; accent purple `#a855f7` or `#8b5cf6`; hover/depth purple `#6d28d9`. Use purple for buttons, links, progress bars, borders, and focus rings.
- Fully responsive (mobile-first): e.g. breakpoints at 640px (sm), 768px (md), 1024px (lg), 1280px (xl). Touch-friendly targets, readable font sizes.
- Smooth scrolling, subtle scroll-triggered animations, hover effects. Sticky navigation header. Modern UI: glassmorphism, gradient cards, subtle shadows.

**Sections**

1. **Homepage / Hero**
   - Main greeting with stylish animation (e.g. typewriter, fade-in, or gradient text).
   - Name and title/role (e.g. "Full Stack Developer", "Computer Science Student").
   - Short tagline or value proposition.
   - CTA button (e.g. "View Projects" or "Get in Touch") linking to Projects or Contact; purple accent.
   - Optional subtle purple gradient or pattern in hero background.

2. **About**
   - Brief bio: education, experience, interests.
   - Highlight skills/tools (HTML, CSS, JS, React, Node, etc.); can link to Skills section.
   - Personal statement or career goals.
   - Optional avatar/image or illustration (with alt text).
   - Optional timeline or animated highlights for UX.

3. **Projects / Work Portfolio**
   - 3–6 featured projects. Each: name, description, technologies, GitHub link, live link.
   - Cards with hover effects (e.g. scale 1.02, purple border or glow) or modal for details.
   - Optional categories: Featured / Recent / Personal. Thumbnails or small GIFs; optimize and lazy-load images.

4. **Skills / Technologies**
   - Consolidated list: frontend, backend, frameworks, tools. Icons, tags, or progress bars/circular charts; indicate proficiency.
   - Purple for progress fill and icon accents.

5. **Certificates / Achievements**
   - List: course name, issuer, year. Icons or badges; optional PDF download links.

6. **Contact / Social**
   - Email, LinkedIn, GitHub, other socials. Optional contact form with animated submit button; CTA like "Let's work together" or "Hire me". Hover and purple accent on buttons/links.

**Technical**
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JS; or React, Tailwind CSS. Optimize images, minify CSS/JS. Deploy on GitHub Pages or Vercel.
- Structure: e.g. one component/section per area (Hero, About, Projects, Skills, Certificates, Contact); global theme in CSS or Tailwind config; data (projects, skills, certs) in one place for easy edits.

**Quality**
- SEO: semantic headings (h1 → h2 → h3), meta title and description, optional Open Graph.
- Accessibility: alt on images, keyboard navigation, focus states (e.g. purple outline), readable contrast (WCAG AA).
- Branding: consistent black, purple, white; optional logo or signature style.

**Extra**
- Use black for background, white for text, purple for highlights and interactions. Keep the codebase easy to update manually (clear HTML/CSS/JS or React structure and data).

**END — Copy until here**
